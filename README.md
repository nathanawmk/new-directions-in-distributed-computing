We stand today on the brink of a revolution in distributed computing. This groundbreaking paper examines the impact of quantum computing in distributed computing environment.

Consensus algorithms today are based on classical computers. This paper explores new applications of quantum algorithms to distributed consensus. It explores how state machine replication (SMR) can be optimised via the application of quantum algorithms.
